Two possible ways to represent a word as a vector are one-hot encoding and word embeddings.\n\n**One-Hot Encoding**\n\nThe first way to represent a word as a vector is by creating a so-called one-hot encoding, which is simply done by taking a vector of the length of the vocabulary with an entry for each word in the corpus.\n\nIn this way, you have for each word, given it has a spot in the vocabulary, a vector with zeros everywhere except for the corresponding spot for the word which is set to one."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e70cf30124b97e5354817229035e448717599353"},"cell_type":"code","source":"cities = ['London', 'Berlin', 'Berlin', 'New York', 'London']\ncities","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fa32a60f2a6f313ea8bc440942f2d489998b6a0c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"`LabelEncoder` to encode the list of cities into categorical integer values"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3d4ecdc38e764ecfeb1f0d78a16ecf423983cdb9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"encoder = LabelEncoder()\ncity_labels = encoder.fit_transform(cities)\ncity_labels","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"da045f493813e22a4bf274d8e68a7adbcaa39cf8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"OneHotEncoder expects each categorical value to be in a separate row, so you’ll need to reshape the array, then you can apply the encoder:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a811470d725cfc3edacc04cfb8ff40050408b93c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)\ncity_labels = city_labels.reshape((5, 1))\nencoder.fit_transform(city_labels)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9005576faab272d4533590b721b525e726b9b4a4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Word Embeddings**\n\nThis method represents words as dense word vectors (also called word embeddings) which are trained unlike the one-hot encoding which are hardcoded.

Their aim is to map semantic meaning into a geometric space. This geometric space is then called the embedding space.\n\nNow you need to tokenize the data into a format that can be used by the word embeddings. Keras offers a couple of convenience methods for text preprocessing and sequence preprocessing which you can employ to prepare your text.\n\nYou can start by using the Tokenizer utility class which can vectorize a text corpus into a list of integers.

When you think of images, a computer has to deal with a two dimensional matrix of numbers and therefore you need some way to detect features in this matrix. These convolutional layers are able to detect edges, corners and other kinds of textures which makes them such a special tool. The convolutional layer consists of multiple filters which are slid across the image and are able to detect specific features."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2f8b18e5bee409b3da521379c3bb6c6c8a53c075"},"cell_type":"code","source":"embedding_dim = 100\n\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=maxlen))\nmodel.add(layers.Conv1D(128, 5, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(layers.GlobalMaxPooling1D())\nmodel.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\n              loss='binary_crossentropy',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\nmodel.summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8298fb93c84b464ff93e1a0a54a085faacec5ebf"},"cell_type":"code","source":"history = model.fit(X_train, y_train,\n                    epochs=10,\n                    verbose=False,\n                    validation_data=(X_test, y_test),\n                    batch_size=10)\nloss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_train, y_train, verbose=False)\nprint(\"Training Accuracy: {:.4f}\".format(accuracy))\nloss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=False)\nprint(\"Testing Accuracy:  {:.4f}\".format(accuracy))\nplot_history(history)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"985360d558b0fcd6b6f17bd8f7599a091b5aa35c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Hyperparameters Optimization\n\nOne crucial steps of deep learning and working with neural networks is hyperparameter optimization.\n\nAs you saw in the models that we have used so far, even with simpler ones, you had a large number of parameters to tweak and choose from. Those parameters are called hyperparameters. This is the most time consuming part of machine learning and sadly there are no one-fits-all solutions ready.\n\nOne popular method for hyperparameter optimization is **grid search**. What this method does is it takes lists of parameters and it runs the model with each parameter combination that it can find. It is the most thorough way but also the most computationally heavy way to do this. Another common way,**random search**, which you’ll see in action here, simply takes random combinations of parameters.\n\nIn order to apply random search with Keras, you will need to use the KerasClassifier which serves as a wrapper for the scikit-learn API. With this wrapper you are able to use the various tools available with scikit-learn like cross-validation. The class that you need is RandomizedSearchCV which implements random search with cross-validation. Cross-validation is a way to validate the model and take the whole data set and separate it into multiple testing and training data sets.\n\nThere are various types of cross-validation. One type is the k-fold cross-validation. In this type the data set is partitioned into k equal sized sets where one set is used for testing and the rest of the partitions are used for training. This enables you to run k different runs, where each partition is once used as a testing set. So, the higher k is the more accurate the model evaluation is, but the smaller each testing set is."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b347dfa060395fafe259a56d4bf4385d213a6727"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def create_model(num_filters, kernel_size, vocab_size, embedding_dim, maxlen):\n    model = Sequential()\n    model.add(layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=maxlen))\n    model.add(layers.Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size, activation='relu'))\n    model.add(layers.GlobalMaxPooling1D())\n    model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'))\n    model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\n    model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n                  loss='binary_crossentropy',\n                  metrics=['accuracy'])\n    return model","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"cbdba00bf86fe148d34f58051aa8b74aa410894f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"param_grid = dict(num_filters=[32, 64, 128],\n                  kernel_size=[3, 5, 7],\n                  vocab_size=[5000], \n                  embedding_dim=[50],\n                  maxlen=[100])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a33d1066e49c58b8305208f5a59d220f7097bcb8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Main settings\nepochs = 20\nembedding_dim = 50\nmaxlen = 100\noutput_file = 'output.txt'\n\n# Run grid search for each source (yelp, amazon, imdb)\nfor source, frame in df.groupby('source'):\n    print('Running grid search for data set :', source)\n    sentences = df['sentence'].values\n    y = df['label'].values\n\n    # Train-test split\n    sentences_train, sentences_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n        sentences, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=1000)\n\n    # Tokenize words\n    tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=5000)\n    tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences_train)\n    X_train = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences_train)\n    X_test = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences_test)\n\n    # Adding 1 because of reserved 0 index\n    vocab_size = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1\n\n    # Pad sequences with zeros\n    X_train = pad_sequences(X_train, padding='post', maxlen=maxlen)\n    X_test = pad_sequences(X_test, padding='post', maxlen=maxlen)\n\n    # Parameter grid for grid search\n    param_grid = dict(num_filters=[32, 64, 128],\n                      kernel_size=[3, 5, 7],\n                      vocab_size=[vocab_size],\n                      embedding_dim=[embedding_dim],\n                      maxlen=[maxlen])\n    model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model,\n                            epochs=epochs, batch_size=10,\n                            verbose=False)\n    grid = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=model, param_distributions=param_grid,\n                              cv=4, verbose=1, n_iter=5)\n    grid_result = grid.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n    # Evaluate testing set\n    test_accuracy = grid.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n    # Save and evaluate results\n#     prompt = input(f'finished {source}; write to file and proceed?
